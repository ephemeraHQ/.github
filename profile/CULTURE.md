# **Ephemera Culture: How We Work**

We’re building the future of communication.

To do it right, we have to work differently.

---

## **Values (Our Counterintuitive Edge)**

### **1) Open By Default**

**What It Means**

The best way to trust something is for it to be open. Trust can’t be demanded — it has to be earned by letting anyone verify for themselves. We publish protocols, code, roadmaps, and even mistakes so people don’t have to take our word for it. Excellent communication — mostly writing — turn openness from noise into leverage.

**How It Shows Up**

- Open protocols, open code, open applications — by default.
- Publish our thinking early to coordinate the ecosystem.
- Treat writing in public as a core product skill.
- Writing is the great leverage

**Tagline** → **If it’s open, you don’t have to trust us.**

### **2) Prove it > Believe it**

**What It Means** 

We care more about finding what’s right than thinking we are right. That means moving fast to prove or disprove our own ideas and having the humility to say “I don’t know” so people can trust us when we *do* know. The faster we kill what’s wrong, the faster we double down on what’s right.

**How It Shows Up**

- Truth comes from practice, not theory. Make ideas tangible to test them ASAP.
- Optimize for time-to-truth
- Show don’t tell
- Say “I don’t know”

**Tagline** → Assume we’re wrong if we want to be right.

### **3) Direction, then speed**

**What It Means**

Make sure we are working on the right thing. The biggest mistake we all make is spending time optimizing something that shouldn’t exist at all or is the wrong thing. Always be asking “is this the right thing?”

Skills and tools change. Taste and judgment — knowing *what* to do — endure. Our job is to ensure we are going the right direction and delivering the right thing. Doing the right thing is the most important thing. How we do it will always change. Sprinting in the wrong direction is the fastest way to get nowhere.

**How It Shows Up**

- Taste first: decide *what* to do before focusing on *how* to do it.
- Design, privacy, and security as foundations
- Keep asking: *How do we know if we’re going the wrong direction? How do we know if we’re working on the wrong thing?*

**Tagline** → **Right, then fast.**

### **4) Delete, Delete, Delete**

**Tagline:** The best feature is no feature.

**What It Means**

People say “simple.” Living it is much harder. Radical simplicity at its core is deleting things. Removing things. Constraining things. Doing radically less.

**How It Shows Up**

- Delete unnecessary process, layers, and complexity. Reduce surface area.
- Coordination requires everyone to say the same thing. Say less.
- Remove so much it hurts — then add back only what’s missing.
- Use AI to help us write less, better — not more, generic. We have to fight the urge for AI to always create more. Greatness comes from removing things and simplifying things. [Here’s an AI prompting guide to help you.](https://chatgpt.com/share/68c211ae-1d88-8012-81fa-b1d797d20a89)

We’re wired to add more. More feels like progress. But it’s a fallacy. Progress comes from ruthless subtraction. In a protocol world, coordination is the hardest thing and we can’t simplify enough.

### **5) Go to the Person**

**Tagline:** Relationships run the world.

**What It Means**

The most important things aren’t built in docs, DMs, or Zoom calls — they’re built face-to-face. Trust, breakthroughs, and lasting partnerships happen when you take the time to show up in person.

**How It Shows Up**

- Take the flight, go to the room, meet the person.
- When things stall, don’t send another message — go for a walk.
- Prioritize real human connection over “work about work.”

### **6) XMTP is for Everyone**

**Tagline:** Communication belongs to everyone.

**What It Means**

XMTP is built for everyone, so we can’t exclude anyone. To make that possible, we don’t impose our personal ideologies or beliefs onto the network. We exist because secure communication is a universal human right.

**How It Shows Up**

- People work here because they believe in secure communication for everyone in the world.
- We focus on what unites us, not what divides us.
- We champion causes directly tied to our mission and steer clear of those that don’t.

### **7) We Create Space for Direct Communication**

**Tagline:** Direct is respectful. Clear is kind.

**What It Means**

Real communication requires openness and understanding. We make it safe to speak directly — with empathy, listening, and respect — because honesty builds trust and better decisions.

**How It Shows Up**

- One-on-ones, group discussions, and open meetings give everyone space to speak.
- Listening fully before responding.
- Direct, respectful feedback as the norm — even when opinions diverge.

Many cultures prioritize harmony over honesty. We believe honest, direct communication — delivered with respect — is the only way to build lasting trust.

## **Principles (Foundations We Never Compromise)**

- **Security First** → *Secure, or it doesn’t ship.*
- Decentralization is the future of trust in the world.
- Privacy, encryption, and threat-modeling are non-negotiable.

These aren’t values we debate — they are the baseline for even existing.

## **Rituals (How We Live This Every Week)**

*Over the years, we’ve learned that some things we can’t control and other things we can. Rituals are about focusing and being disciplined on the things that we can control. How we show up, how we commit to things, how we communicate, and how we think. We can always change and challenge rituals, but if they are on this list we are expected to follow them.*

- **We Think in Weeks** → Everything breaks into weekly sprints. Even long-term, huge projects must show weekly progress.
- **Monday Roadmap** → Leads meet every Monday (required), anyone can join (optional). This keeps direction and priorities aligned.
- **Friday All Hands + Show & Tell** → Every Friday, the whole team gathers. Show & Tell means screen-sharing something learned, built, or personal. It’s about openness and connection.
- **Friday Dispatch** → Every week for 219+ weeks, Shane (co-founder/CEO) writes a dispatch: what he’s thinking, decisions, achievements, and operations. Never missed a week. Read all past dispatches here: [](https://www.notion.so/ba3b5bc42e594e4b94a227aa3c60a84a?pvs=21)
- [**Living Public Roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/xmtp/projects/34/) → Every person is responsible for keeping it current. We over-communicate progress.
- The 1-Pager → A forcing function to make ideas real, specific, and edited down to their essence. [Here’s the template.](https://www.notion.so/The-Ephemera-1-Pager-25130823ce92804fab70fbd3c5f7cf0e?pvs=21)
- [**XIPs & RFCs**](https://community.xmtp.org/) → We crystallize major protocol and product initiatives into clear formats to get feedback early and in the open.
- **Proactive Communication** → We communicate before partners or the community ask. We keep people calm by keeping them informed.

### **Why This Matters**

These values aren’t about being safe or polished. They’re about being different in ways that matter: open where others are closed, humble where others posture, focused where others scatter.

The principles keep us grounded. The rituals keep us honest. Together, they make Ephemera a place where the future of communication gets built the right way.
